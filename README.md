# Changesets

Hello my people! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to use
Based on the scripts localed at the root `package.json`

### Requirements

Make sure to have all packages installed:

```
pnpm install
```

### Creating a Changeset
```
pnpm create-changeset
```
Follow the prompts to specify the files, and type of version bump:
```
Patch: 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 — Bug fixes or minor improvements.
Minor: 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 — Backward-complatible new/significant improvements.
Major: 1.0.0 to 2.0.0 — Breaking changes not backward-compatible.
```

Describe the changes. Example input (automatically created under `.changeset`)


A summary file is created with a rancom name, for example `tame-emus-send.md
```
---
"@stcland/rest-hooks": patch
---

patch bumping test for rest-hooks
```

### Setting the Version

 Apply the version changes based on the changesets

 ```
 pnpm set-version
 ```
### Build the packages

_It is very important to build, before publishing a new version._

```
pnpm build:all
```

### Publishing Packages

Publish packages based on the changesets:

```
pnpm publish:changeset
```

For the first time you can also publish All Packages using this script:
```
pnpm publish:all
```
### Nice to know but not recommended

_Once a version is unpublished, you CAN'T publish the same version again._

Under the `npm cli` if you want to unpublish a package use:

```
npm unpublish `@package/name@<version>`
```
