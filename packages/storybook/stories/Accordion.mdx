# Accordion Components

The `Accordion` component provides collapsible sections, 
following the WAI-ARIA pattern for show/hide functionality. 
It offers flexibility for content organization and supports custom styling, state management, and accessibility.

## Properties

### Accordion
- **children** (`React.ReactNode`): Content to be rendered inside the accordion.
- **id** (`string`): Unique identifier for accessibility purposes. Required for proper WAI-ARIA support.
- **defaultExpanded** (`boolean`): If `true`, the accordion is expanded by default. Defaults to `false`.
- **className** (`string`): Additional CSS classes for styling.
- **customStyles**(`Partial<AccordionStyles>`): Allows passing custom styles for all child elements.
- **...rest**: Other HTML props such as `aria-*` or `data-*` attributes.

Base:
- **children** (`React.ReactNode`): The header or title of the accordion section.
- **className** (`string`): Additional CSS classes for styling.

With Expanded Icon:
