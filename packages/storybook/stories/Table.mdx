You can control the expansion state of rows and customize the appearance of expanded rows with styles.

### Features:
- **Row expansion state management**: Control the expanded state for individual and all rows.
- **Expand/Collapse Controls**: Display the buttons or icons to expand or collaps rows.
- **Nested Row Styles**: Apply custom styles to distinguish between main rows and sub-rows.

## WithStyles Wrapper

When a component is exported from the `@stcland/components/withStyles` module and wrapped in the `StcStylesProvider` it allow 
users to access styled versions of the core components. These components enhance the base functionality with added styling without
the need to pass a `customStyles` property as the **With Custom Styles** example above.
